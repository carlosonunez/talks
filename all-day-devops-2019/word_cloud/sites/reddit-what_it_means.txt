Guidelines
	•	Please keep submissions on topic and of high quality.

	•	No surveys.
	•	Please follow proper reddiquette.

Info
	•	Do you have a question? Check out /r/learnprogramming, /r/cscareerquestions, or Stack Overflow.
	•	Do you have something funny to share with fellow programmers? Please take it to /r/ProgrammerHumor/.

I really don't understand the difference between the expectations of an sre and engineers. The things sre ends up doing should be expected of any experienced engineer. Why is monitor, deploy and make sure code and services are reliable a unique job? How is this just not built into the job requirements of not getting fired as a developer? SRE only exists in the web world, there are none for things like developing for mobile.
fwiw, my title is sre...

It's a priority thing. For example, if you push out a feature n months ago, it may not be in your peripheral as to being an issue for any number of reasons. Perhaps the SLA says 3s response, but it's 5s and you don't know that. Maybe a client is doing something weird that's a blip in monitoring, but you don't have time to track down. In larger organisations, you may be dealing with types of engineering that's not SRE focused, where an SRE may be looking at all metrics, triaging and organising things to be "better."

I don't see why all of that should not be part of the job for a swe. Maintenance to fix bugs, make sure the stuff you write is reliable enough to meet an sla. That's not a job title, it should just be being good at your job. The expectations of code written are poor and it's just being pushed off to others. It's nonsensical to me.

By the same token, front end, back end, ops, is all in reach of a developer. But as an organisation grows, you'll end up splitting responsibilities up. Not that anyone should eschew performance, good behaviour, etc... but in an org of say, 10k developers, there's a chance you lose visibility over time in a sea of people.
