We are the Google Site Reliability team. We make Google’s websites work. Ask us Anything! (self.IAmA)
2234 points submitted 6 years ago * by sre_pointyhairGoogle SRE
Hello, reddit!
We are the Google Site Reliability (SRE) team. We’re responsible for the 24x7 operation of Google.com, as well as the technical infrastructure behind many other Google products such as GMail, Maps, G+ and other stuff you know and love. We’ve been traditionally invisible and behind-the-scenes but we thought we’d drop on here and answer any questions about what we do, what stuff we come up against, and what it’s like to be an SRE.
Other interesting things to give you an idea of what we do:
Blog post about the Leap Second written by Chris Pascoe from SRE give an ides of the kind of hairy problems we come up against.
Steven Levy wrote a Wired Article about inside our datacenters, and managed to make us sound like some sort of amazing justice team.
Kripa (who’s one of our participants today!) also writes about DiRT for ACM Queue.
We’ll be here from 12pm to 2pm PST to answer your questions, when we'll have info on our participants.
Proof (official Google accounts) : 
https://plus.google.com/+GoogleDevelopers/posts/AjoRBrKYvsR https://twitter.com/googledevs/status/294234581303967745
EDIT 11:50PST: We're just getting set up here to answer your questions. We are:
Kripa Krishnan (/u/kripakrishnan), SRE Technical Program Manager and DiRT mastermind from our Mountain View HQ. Kripa works on infrastructure efforts in Google Apps. 
Cody Smith (/u/clusteroops), long-time senior SRE from Mountain View. Cody works on Search and Infrastructure.
Dave O’Connor (/u/sre_pointyhair), Site Reliability Manager from our Dublin, Ireland office. Dave manages the Storage SRE team in Dublin that runs Bigtable, Colossus, Spanner, and other storage tech our products are built on.
John Collins (/u/jrc-sre), SRE Ombudsman, advocate and general force for good, from Mountain View. 
EDIT 13:56PST: OK folks, we're all done. Thanks for the questions, hope our answers were satisfactory. May the queries flow and the pagers be silent.
*EDIT Jan 30: Corrected the spelling of @stevenlevy's name. Whoops-a-daisy. *

What's the biggest 'Oh shit' moment you've ever had?
		permalinkembedsave



[–]kripakrishnanGoogle SRE 321 points 6 years ago 
Each year we do a test of the resilience of our systems as part of an exercise called DiRT (Disaster Recovery Testing). DiRT was developed to find vulnerabilities in critical systems and business processes by intentionally causing failures in them, and to fix them before such failures happen in an uncontrolled manner. DiRT tests both Google's technical robustness, by breaking live systems. The expected behavior is that no one will notice anything because our systems are resilient to such failures. This is usually a very exciting time for SREs in Google.
One of the tests we did was that of taking down a single old database shard just to see what would happen -- a seemingly harmless test. And then we realized we brought down over 30 of our front ends that depended on this single shard. You know that got fixed. (For more: http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2371516)

Running this script will mark you all as submitters, giving you the blue highlight.
In Chrome you can just copy paste into your address bar (chrome removes the "javascript:" at the start, so you have to add that manually).
In Firefox: If you hit shift+F4 (or go to web developer - Scratchpad in the menu) in FF, it should open a scratchpad. If you paste the code there, and run it (Ctrl + R, or use the menu), it should work.
javascript:(function(){ 
var arr = document.getElementsByClassName("id-t2_a4rx7");
for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
   arr[i].className = arr[i].className + " submitter";
}

var arr = document.getElementsByClassName("id-t2_abse2");
for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
   arr[i].className = arr[i].className + " submitter";
}

var arr = document.getElementsByClassName("id-t2_acnhz");
for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
   arr[i].className = arr[i].className + " submitter";
}

var arr = document.getElementsByClassName("id-t2_ablrr");
for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
   arr[i].className = arr[i].className + " submitter";
}})()

"Oh shit, I'm oncall for the first time"?
		permalinkembedsaveparentgive award






[–][deleted] 94 points 6 years ago* 
My favorite moment as a Google SRE on Gmail was when we had a bug causing storage system to fill endlessly. After months of debugging, and on the day before Christmas Eve, one of our ultra smart engineers had discovered what was causing it, and had figured out a way to fix it.
As the SRE on call I was tasked with safely applying the fix. We worked together change the setting not really knowing it what it would do at scale. First test on a million users or so worked good, so I started rolling it out globally.
The storage dropped like a rock. Total stored bytes was falling like a rock (think terra bytes of deleted data every page reload. After a bunch of heart stopingly "oh shit! oh shit! oh shit! What have I done?!" moments and a mad scramble too figure out how to not lose peoples email, it flattened out.. Everything was normal. Nothing was reported as missing. All valid data was intact.
The other engineer looked at me and said: "you just deleted more useless data in an hour than most people will create in their lifetimes..
I am still terrified of the oh shit feeling, but prideful of the non oh shit outcome. =)

We get attacked all the time, although most are so small or simple that our systems automatically diffuse or block them. For the larger products (e.g. Search, GMail), we only really need to manually intervene a handful of times per year.
Home page outages almost never affect all users simultaneously. There many different systems involved in simply connecting users to Google, and most incidents happen outside of our network. We do occasionally have network outages, which are regional, e.g. a few states or countries. We also occasionally introduce language-specific bugs, e.g. garbling CJK. As far as I can recall, the last global outage was back in 2005:

My usual response to those questions is:
1) Google gets DDoS'd constantly. You could even consider all of the combined users' normal usage of the site a kind of DDoS, given its scale.
2) Google doesn't go down because secops and netops are smart.

There's only so much difference between a DDoS and a surge of legitimate users. Reddit often causes DDoS's of love on small websites that get linked here. Long story short, all popular sites are under some form of DDoS, it's the way that they handle the traffic that makes it awesome.
I remember reading somewhere that in the early days of Google, a data center caught fire. This was when Google was still barely 2-3 years old IIRC. Even then, the site had already been set up so that the persistent backups kicked in and there was practically no downtime.

What skills are required to be an SRE member? Are you hardware engineers? Software guys? Do you write shell scripts? Program Lego robots to drive around datacenters all day turning servers off-and-on?
		permalinkembedsavegive award



[–]sre_pointyhairGoogle SRE[S] 188 points 6 years ago 
There are a bunch of people of many different backgrounds that make up SRE - hardware, software, networks, security, etc. Your average SRE usually concentrates on software in their day to day work, although you do need to know hardware to do stuff like qualifying new hardware platforms (we do a bunch of this in Storage, where we qualify new drive sizes, new boards, etc. for our software such as colossus). We do write code to support the service, and also contribute code to the software itself (i.e. it’s often easier and faster to just send a patch to the software, rather than opening a feature request). 
As for essential skills, it’s hard to define strictly (that’s one of the reasons why it’s so difficult to find good SREs). We take people from a pure software engineering background, sysadmins, network architects, and sometimes people come out of left field from completely different industries to surprise us with their ability to do the job (we did have one guy join SRE who used to be a motorcycle racer).

Data centers are staffed by HwOps (hardware operations) OEs (operations engineers). SRE plays a role, but the OEs are the ones who keep the hardware side of things going. SREs and OEs work together to keep the infrastructure together on a day to day basis. FWIW I work in one of the larger of googles data centers and would be happy to answer questions (that I legally can) on that issue.

Not quite a easter egg, but one of my favorite esoteric features is the unit disambiguation in the calculator. For instance, a "pound" could be mass, force, or currency, so you can ask for something ridiculous like:

[–]mrmackdaddy 54 points 6 years ago 
Well, as he said, "pound" can be a unit of mass (pound-mass), force (pound-force), or currency (British Pound). If something were for some reason expressed in terms of a mass times a force times a currency it could be a "Pound pound pound". You could convert it into different units like the kilogram (mass), newton (force), and US dollars (currency) which is what clusteroops is doing.

What do you think the biggest misconception that people have about what you do?
		permalinkembedsavegive award



[–]sre_pointyhairGoogle SRE[S] 121 points 6 years ago 
One misconception we do have is that we’re an ops/admin group or a NOC. It’s our responsibility to keep the site up, no matter what - that involves working at a scale that’s staggering, and you run into problems you’ve never seen before. You need good engineers who know how to work from first principles on a system that they may not have “trained on” and figure out what’s up, and get to a resolution within minutes, not hours. We also write a bunch of code to make sure the systems stay in a happy state. We do oncall, sure, but we’re also on the hook for doing automation and mitigation such that oncall isn’t a terrible experience and doesn’t keep you up all night.
SRE is often a better experience for someone who likes to write code. Ben talks about some of that here: https://plus.google.com/+ResearchatGoogle/posts/Vtd6HPAiU5c

Oh, sorry - work-life balance:
It’s what you make it. As a manager, it’s part of my job to make sure that people are able to manage their own work-life balance. We do personal objectives on a larger timescale than I’ve done at other places, so rather than saying “This needs to be done this week”, it’s more like “This needs to be done this month, you’re clever, figure it out”. Personally, I’m able to balance things pretty effectively, and I’d hate to think people who report to me didn’t have the same opportunity (while getting their stuff done, of course).

Oncall is part of being a SWE at Google whether you work on production services, in SRE or "pure dev" roles. All SWE groups producing user-visible or production code have these oncall rotations but, many ave timezone-shifted support so when you are oncall, it doesn't include overnights (i.e. you will get sleep). SRE's oncall rotations are generally more organized and consistent than most of SWE teams.

Lots and lots of tools, most of which we write ourselves. Probably too many to fit in this box. 
One big one is a monitoring system called "Borgmon". It collects, aggregates, and records instrumentation data, draws graphs, sends alerts, and dispenses candy. It's extremely powerful, but painful to use, because it has its own programming language. So we have a love-hate relationship with it.

[–]clusteroopsGoogle SRE 88 points 6 years ago 
Sleep schedule: roughly 12-2 to 8-10. Oncall doesn't affect it much, since teammates in different time zones cover nights. And I'm only oncall roughly one week in six.
Team size: roughly 40 in my group, which takes care of Google Search. We're spread across Mountain View, Dublin, and Zurich. But I regularly work closely with many other groups.
Larry and Sergey: both several times. I even briefly shared an office with Sergey.

Sleep schedules vary, its more about your personal approach. In SRE, the on call schedules provide a lot of structure, so its usually pretty reasonable. Working with groups in other time zones is where it can stretch a bit, if you want to keep in video conference contact with them. I lose more sleep because of my kids than work (I’m not currently on call, but it still applies).
“The team” is kind of a nebulous term. We have lots of different sized teams, with varying amount of overlap. My personal team at the moment is 4 people (we’re hiring!) and we’re not an on call group. We’re spending our time on strategic planning of the infrastructure.
I’ve met them both, on several different occasions, usually when we’re looking for a decision on something big enough to include them, sometimes during a high level review of something as well. SRE can be involved in rather large decisions like where should we be putting data centers. We get to focus on Engineering problems and talk about them with Larry and/or Sergey. They still spend time talking on Engineering, not just typical business questions, and you can still bump into them in the hallways too.

Hi there!
As someone who is currently majoring in Computer Science and has spent a lot of time working in kitchens the idea of being on the SRE team is so unbelievably appealing it's almost difficult to put into words.
One of my favorite things about being in a kitchen is the extreme rush, adrenaline, and stress that all combines with a necessity for quick rational thought and on your feet problem solving. The first time I read about DiRT I fell in love with the idea instantly. I have a couple questions relating to participating in the events.
	•	Is it really as fun as I think it is? Since I love intense stress, adrenaline, problem solving, high-pressure situations, and computers it seems like a dream come true 
	•	What sort of CIS focus would you recommend for the SRE team? 
	•	How often does the team have "Oh shit" moments where something major breaks and you have to jump into action? What kind of things are breaking in those moments? 
Thanks for doing the AMA! The work you all do is incredibly inspiring and motivational.
		permalinkembedsavegive award



[–]sre_pointyhairGoogle SRE[S] 36 points 6 years ago 
Dirt is pretty badass when it happens -- it’s a global exercise, so having the pager go off with “DiRT has occurred, battle stations” or whatever is a rush for sure. We try to formulate the tests and manage the time such that it’s as close as possible to the real situation (some teams organise round-the-clock rotations for the exercise in the office, we get catering in, that sort of thing).
As for CIS focus, anything that involves abstract problem-solving is going to be good. I often lament that there’s no ‘degree in sysadmin’. You either get a tech-specific course or something focused on just programming (or a particular language). Anything that exposes you to good, resilient design practices and doesn’t overly focus on specific tech is usually best. Sorry for the wishy-washy answer, but there’s no silver bullet here, really. We hire people who have no degrees at all, if they have the experience and skills.
Things break at a reasonable rate. We’re here to engineer away a lot of the things we can in design, or with redundancy, so for a lot of our tech, ‘fire drills’ are uncommon. They do happen, though, and there’s a certain rush to dealing with them, like with any reactive work.

[–]wiseasss 16 points 6 years ago 
I don't think a "reliability team" is what you think it is. The key to making a big service reliable isn't waiting for shit to break and then dealing with "extreme rush, adrenaline, and stress" (else we'd see Google down all the time for a minute at a time). It's planning ahead. On a good day, nothing interesting happens at all.
If you want computers + stress, go start your own company, and face each day not knowing whether your job will be around tomorrow or not.
Thinking that an SRE team is exciting is like thinking that being a sailor on a submarine is exciting because you saw Sean Connery do it, or that cops have thrilling jobs because you saw Bruce Willis retake a skyscraper from hostages. What you don't see is that 99.9% of the time it's about as boring as can be.
As Spolsky once said:
I suppose some software shops have last-minute coding frenzies like this. If so, their software is probably marked by incredibly poor quality.
The fact that Google is so reliable is a testament to how good the Google SRE are, and consequently how boring their jobs must be.

[–]0xfe 16 points 6 years ago

We all know Google has some unique benefits, but what is the best part about working for Google that we probably haven't heard about?
		permalinkembedsavegive award



[–]sre_pointyhairGoogle SRE[S] 87 points 6 years ago 
I know this will sound corny (especially from the grumpy Irishman) but it has to be the people. Being in a place where you can interact with a group of people who are interesting and good at what they do, but who are also on average interesting people is probably what keeps the community strong and people staying here.
Having access to free food, gyms, other facilities is great, but the novelty would wear off pretty quickly if you had to deal with people you don’t want to work with for whatever reason (i.e. they’re not good so you have to carry them, or they’re just not interesting). We have people in Dublin who make swords, play with lasers, and anything else you’d care to think of. It is kind of terrifying (in a good way) to ask “Does anyone have a lend of a medieval fighting axe” on a mailing list, and get a positive response.

Also a former Googler, SRE; I was cautious when I started at Google, not sure if I'd be a culture fit because of my privacy concerns. I relaxed after the intro class from the engineer in charge of logs, as I realised that Google's triumvirate had solved the privacy problem by putting in charge of the logs an engineer who was even more of a privacy nut than I was. She was seriously protective of users' data, and was able to write the policies to reflect that.

Ex-Googler: I really doubt they're able to answer that last one, since speaking negatively about your competitors in public is a no-no. However, since I don't work there anymore, I'll give it a shot:
I like Bing a lot, and I believe that a lot of the ideas they've come up with over the years have been pretty innovative and impressive. Competition is really important from a user's point of view, and right now, I just feel like there's no good alternative to Google. The main reason is that Bing, quite frankly, just looks way too similar to Google. The UI is almost exactly the same, except the ads are of worse quality, they do a slightly worse job dealing with some of the more egregious forms of SEO (their results for long-tail queries aren't that bad), and they have a separate panel for Facebook results which rarely (if ever) has anything interesting in it.
They need to radically change their UI and UX such that searching on Bing is a very different experience from searching on Google. As it stands, searching on Bing just feels like you're using Google except it kinda sucks more.

Answering based on my personal experience:
1: Almost none. In practice, aggregated instrumentation data suffices to solve most problems.
2: Queries of death, which cause numerous systems to crash simultaneously. Although we have numerous layers of protection against QoDs these days.
3: A lot. (Seriously though, it's complicated and differs between products and features, so no blanket statement would be very useful.)
4: We typically go straight to our dashboards, which give a heads-up view of many different systems. These allow us to quickly identify the scope of the problem, and likely point of failure. Our first response is usually to mitigate damage by diverting queries at the load balancing layer.
5: Aww, shucks.
6: We don’t delegate to Secops - they run as a separate organisation that does (among many other things) incident management, and security reviews for upcoming launches. We usually talk to them pre-launch for anything that’s sensitive, and they rank highly when we’re triaging bug reports and user reports of problems with products we run.

How much information do you have on most people and who is able to acces it? (like can someone just acces my e-mail, youtube and google search results and/or sites is visit while using chrome?)

Not part of the AMA (but I interned there), but since there are no responses to you yet...
They're very concerned about security. All accesses to user data is logged and any unauthorized access is severely punished. Different levels of access require different permissions. The requirements around password resets, for example, aren't that strict (I think there's a support team that does it and has permission). If I remember correctly, access to manually view and peruse your information requires a specific reason and approval from very high up the chain. Basically, I was a little worried about them abusing my data before I worked there, but I trust them completely to protect my data now. Any access to data is automatic and programmatic, usually for tailoring searches or ads to you specifically.
In terms of how much... I'd say they probably have everything you've given them that you haven't asked them to delete.
Edit: Also, see this by weareconvo, who knows more about it than I do http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/177267/we_are_the_google_site_reliability_team_we_make/c82t6ir

I once asked my brother (web dev) what the pinnacle of web scripting on a site was, and he answered google docs. 
It made me wonder - have you ever done a big 'under the hood' revamp of one of your products that the end user was never supposed to notice? How is it?

What are the majority of the problems you encounter caused from, what is the biggest problem you encounter when trying to fix said problems? With a company so large as Google, is internal communication a major issue when relying on other teams to fix things?

[–]sre_pointyhairGoogle SRE[S] 51 points 6 years ago 
I don’t think we can narrow down to a small number of root causes, the number of things that can affect services is staggering - everything from software fault to cuts in fiber in random places (we do have seasonal problems with fiber cuts in certain places. hunters get bored when they run out of game to shoot and start shooting fiber distribution boxes). This is why you’re never bored as an SRE - you can never make assumptions about the root cause of a problem :-)
We’re really focused on keeping our teams in touch and in sync with each other -- being in the Dublin office means a lot of videoconferences, being able to manage email and IM, that sorta thing. We use hangouts pretty heavily internally to keep up to date with teams and individuals.

I am a sysadmin at a company that insists on using our local time zone for internal logging instead of UTC. You can imagine how things get screwed up twice every year because of Daylight Savings. Now that we're opening other offices, it's not even "local" for everyone.
My superiors don't see this as a problem. Are there any arguments you could provide for the use of UTC based on your experiences that might convince them?

This one is hard to answer - each year has it’s own theme and it’s all fun. We’ve had our action hero (based on a top executive in Google) save the day with Portals. We’ve had ‘rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty’, and we’ve had zombies. We even have our own music videos sometimes.

How do you manage outages in systems written by other people? I've heard that once a system is stable enough, devs don't do oncall anymore and pass everything to you guys? If a system written by someone else fails at 3 am and you can't figure out an obvious problem, how do you proceed for the quick fix?
Also, as SRE do you do any dev work? And vice-versa, do developers usually do regular oncall rotation, or they do it just for recently launched services and then pass it to you after an uneventful couple of weeks?
Thanks for the AMA!! 99% of our teams don't have dedicated ops people and oncall period is definitely the most stressful and important for us! You do learn a lot more and a lot faster though so I guess it's a tradeoff!
		permalinkembedsavegive award



[–]clusteroopsGoogle SRE 21 points 6 years ago 
Other people: we review systems before agreeing to maintain them, which helps us understand how they work and how they can fail. After handoff, the developers don't just disappear, they remain around to continue supporting the product. And in practice, we often escalate to them for particularly tricky problems. We have their phone numbers.
Dev work: absolutely. We expect to spend no more than 50% time on ops work, although it varies by team in practice. Developers also do oncall, particularly because SRE support for any given system is not inevitable. We focus on high reliability and efficiency for Google's most important systems, and not basic care and feeding for every system ever produced.

Google.com obviously runs quite complicated software. From what I have gathered, most of it is C++, Java or Python. (Correct?)
Does the SRE team treat the software like a black box and mostly work with the diagnostic and debugging features its software developers left in, or do you also dig into the source code to do actual live debugging yourself?
If you do, how do you manage to keep up your knowledge of the code/architecture as the various products are developed by their teams? 
Do you have people who specialize in the various products, or do you prefer to keep your team as generalists?
		permalinkembedsave



[–]clusteroopsGoogle SRE 25 points 6 years ago 
Debugging: we do a fair amount of black box monitoring, but for debugging our focus is on instrumentation and logging. In practice, many of the systems are so complex that we can't practically tell what they're doing unless they tell us. In fact, we often add instrumentation or logging to existing code to make the debugging process easier.
Keeping up: we review major changes before they launch, and regularly work with developers to ensure the systems remain scrutable.
Specialization: yes! My team focuses on Google Search. At a minimum, we all need to be capable of mitigating damage when any part of the system fails, and narrowing the root cause. But for day-to-day work, we regularly specialize in certain subsystems.

Do you ever feel envious that guys who build features get all the credit while you guys operate "behind the scenes" and make sure everything is very smooth (which by the way seems to me much harder and more stressful than pure dev work)?
		permalinkembedsavegive award



[–]jrc-sreGoogle SRE 27 points 6 years ago 
Personally, I don’t. 3 reasons... (1) Folks within Google are usually very appreciative of the work we do. So, we actually do get quite a bit of kudos. (2) Usually by the time people recognize something we did, we’ve already moved on to something else, and actually solving whatever problems we’re facing is why I come to work every day. (3) I like solving big, hairy problems that haven’t been solved before. That usually means having someone else think up something crazy and then I get to figure out how to actually make it work.
And, just to point it out, the features and solutions are always better when its not just “guys” coming up with them. Our best work comes when we have a bunch of different folks contributing.

Not really. In reality, SREs have a pretty integral role in making launches happen. We’re as proud of the stuff we help to put out as the people who design or produce them, and it’s amazing to see how it affects people’s lives. Example: I was listening to a Jazz radio station the other day in the car, and they were reading out random cities people were visiting their live stream from, from Google Analytics Real-Time. I helped launch that last year, and it was an exciting time for everyone involved. Moments like that make it not really matter if my name’s in an easter egg :-)
